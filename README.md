My personal remake of the original Super Mario Maker.NET fan game. I was 14 years old when I
started this.

# Super Mario Maker.NET Build More!

I never added a description to this remake, but let me tell you a brief history of how it came
into existance:

Sometime around 2021, me (Batata Douce) and Koop the Koopa decided to make our own versions of
the Super Mario Maker.NET fan game, which we were part of the small group of boys that somehow
got access to computers and developed that mess.

Koop created Super Mario Maker.NET Extra" and a site for the original SMM.NET (both which you
can access below), although he never finished them.

I, however, created Super Mario Maker.NET Build More!, which currently is far more complete
than SMM.NET Extra. For me, it was what the original Super Mario Maker.NET could have turned
if the code was actually readable and we wanted update it.

# The lost update

Around 2022, I wanted to get back on developing SMM.NET BM, and I was planning to release its
biggest update, alpha 1.2, event that never occurred. Development did hit an advanced stage,
but someday my not-so-great laptop would stop working, so I gave it away ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

It may have become lost media, but I vaguely remember uploading a test version somewhere on
discord, since I did show some pictures of things I was working on for that version, like a
title screen with animated clock and etc.
